## Windows 7 Theme

I tried to replicate the Windows 7 UI in Obsidian with CSS. It's very far from complete, but I'm satisfied and want to move on to actually using the app. Figured I'd upload this to GitHub in case someone wants to tweak it further.

I don't know what I'm doing; expect the CSS file to be very messy.
